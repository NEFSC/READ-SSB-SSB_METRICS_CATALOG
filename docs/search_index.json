Total Trips Description: The sum of trips from each FMP in a calendar year. See definition of trips in a FMP below. Days at Sea Description: The sum of days at sea from each FMP in a calendar year. See definition of Days at Sea in a FMP below. FMP Revenue Description: The sum of total revenue earned from each FMP fishery. See definition of revenue in a FMP below. 4.3.2 FMP-Specific Metrics Vessels *Description: Number of vessels that take at least one trip where more than 50% of its revenue comes from species included in the FMP. Trips Description: Total trips taken in the FMP fishery. A trip is identified as having participated in the fishery if greater than 50% of the revenue for the trip was derived from FMP species. Days at Sea Description: Time from when a vessel leaves port to when it returns on a trip in the FMP fishery. This metric is the sum of all days at sea by all vessels taking a trip in the FMP. The calculation of this metric does not include any demarcation lines. Revenue Description: For each year, the sum of total deflated revenue from species in the FMP fishery (FMP Revenue) and the revenue from other species landed on trips identified as being in the fishery (Non-FMP Revenue). Average Prices Description: For each species in the FMP, this is an implicit price calculated as total deflated revenue divided by total landed pounds. Revenue per Vessel Description: For each vessel included in the FMP data, deflated revenue is divided into FMP revenue and non-FMP revenue. Per vessel revenue is calculated as the total revenue in each category divided by the total vessels in each year. Total Revenue per Trip Description: Total deflated revenue from FMP and non-FMP species divided by the total number of trips identified as having taken place in the fishery. Revenue per Day at Sea Description: Total deflated revenue from both FMP and non-FMP species landed, divided by the total number of days absent on trips in the fishery. Gini Coefficient Description: A measure of revenue inequality in the fishery, and can range between 0 (perfect equality) and 1 (perfect inequality). Perfect inequality means that one entity receives all the revenue from the fishery. Equation: G = Σ (2in - 1)xi / 2nū Where: i = vessel’s rank in revenue in ascending order xi = annual revenue in the fishery for vessel i n = total number of vessels ū = mean vessel revenue 4.4 Additional Methods/Decision Rules 4.4.1 Summary Group Decision Rules FMP defined as at least one trip where more than 50% of its revenue comes from species included in the FMP. 4.4.2 Deflation All dollar values have been deflated using the GDP implicit price deflator, deflating prices to constant dollars for the most recent year where data from the BEA is provided. Deflation code can be found in the website product code. 4.4.3 Matching Trips (veslog - cfders) We match trip and dealer records by vtrserno/serial_num. 4.4.4 Binning Rules A trip is assigned to an FMP based on the highest FMP revenue value. 4.4.5 Average Prices We are only using the average prices for trip records which didn’t have a matching dealer record. For the ones that do, we use the calculated prices from the dealer record. 4.4.6 Exclusions If vtrserno is a match, but permit = ‘000000’, the trip is considered again when looking at orphan trips Mismatched trips (multiple vtrserno corresponding to one tripid, and one(or more) vtrserno has a match, but other(s) do not) are not included in the orphan trips group 4.4.7 Outliers Revenue per Trip metric is used to identify outliers. Outlier removal is based on interquartile test First, Lower (&lt;=0.25) and Upper (&gt;=0.75) Quartile and calculated. Then, the lower bound for determining an outlier is lq-1.5(uq-lq), and the upper bound is uq+1.5*(uq-lq). Any values less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound are removed. 4.5 Data Sources and code 4.5.1 Data Sources CFDBS VTR SFCLAM 4.5.2 Code Metric Creation Code File Location https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-PM Read Me file (file to run code): https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-PM\\README.md Website Production Code Location: https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-PM Read Me file (file to run code): https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-PM/blob/main/README.md "],["vessel-profit-snapshot-website.html", "Chapter 5 2022 Vessel Profit Snapshot Website 5.1 Product Overview 5.2 List of Metrics 5.3 Metric Descriptions 5.4 Additional Methods/Decision Rules 5.5 Data Sources and Code", " Chapter 5 2022 Vessel Profit Snapshot Website 5.1 Product Overview This site presents commercial fishing vessel profits during 2022 for vessels who responded to the Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey * Unit: Vessel-level information (responding vessels only) * Summary Group(s): Primary gear type, FMP and gear of responding vessels * Frequency: Annual * Time Series: Snapshot (2022) 5.1.1 Point of Contact Gregory Ardini (Gregory.Ardini@noaa.gov) 5.1.2 Data Outputs/Outlets https://ardini-noaa.github.io/2022_Vessel_Profit_Snapshots/ 5.2 List of Metrics Revenue Costs Operating profit Total profit 5.3 Metric Descriptions Revenue Commercial revenue All individuals that were sampled for the 2022 cost survey were owners of federally-permitted commercial fishing vessels active in 2021 or 2022. Federally-permitted vessels are required to sell their catch to federally-licensed seafood dealers and commercial revenue is derived from harvested catch on commercial trips sold to a licensed dealer. All vessels included in the profit snapshots generated commercial fishing revenue &gt;$0 during 2022 from landings occurring in the Northeast region (ME to Cape Hatteras, NC). The values reported by dealers feed into the Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS) housed at the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) and the NEFSC. Vessel revenues are queried directly from CAMS with two exceptions. The first is for cases in which there is a reported commercial landing volume in CAMS but no associated value. For these observations, prices were generally imputed as the average species price for 2022 to calculate value (landings*price). If the observation had a dealer disposition code in which a value is not expected (e.g. “No market”, “Personal Use”) then values were left blank. In total, 3.6% of observations used an imputed price rather than a dealer reported price. The second exception is for revenue derived from bluefin tuna as the reporting requirements for this species differs from other species landed in the Northeast region. Bluefin tuna revenue was queried from the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) data warehouse, while all other species revenue was queried from CAMS. For Hire revenue While the 2022 cost survey was sent to vessels engaged in commercial fishing during 2021 or 2022, some of these vessels also were engaged in for-hire fishing. In order to accurately capture vessel-level profits, it is important to include this additional source of revenue. For-hire revenue is derived from angler/customer payments on recreational trips. All 2022 party/charter trips, and the number of anglers per trip, were first pulled from logbook data. Average angler charter/guide fees by state were then retrieved from the results of the 2022 National Angler Expenditure Survey administered by NOAA Fisheries. This survey is conducted every 3-5 years to better understand the economic contribution of recreational fishing within each region. The survey collects information on a variety of angler expenditures including bait, ice, lodging, and travel costs. For the purpose of the vessel profit calculation, only the amount paid by the angler for the party/charter ticket is used. State-level averages from the angler expenditure survey were used in light of the variability in fees by state within the Northeast region as well as the high level of response for each state. The average angler fee was multiplied by the number of anglers for each 2022 party/charter trip by state. Finally, the trip-level calculations were summed to an annual vessel-level value.

These data manipulation steps are summarized below. Trip Expenses Survey respondents were given the option of providing trip expenses either at the annual level or as a trip average. For those respondents who filled in the average cost per trip, the value was multiplied by the number of commercial trips taken during 2022. In general, the number of trips was used directly from the survey (Q2). In cases where this information was not filled in, the number of trips was retrieved from VTRs and/or dealer reports. Trip expenses were then allocated to the vessel owner based on how the survey respondent indicated these expenses were paid (Q6). If the respondent answered that the crew paid for trip expenses, the assigned cost to the vessel owner was $0. If the respondent answered that the boat/owner paid for trip expenses, 100% of these costs were assigned to the vessel owner. If the respondent answered that trip expenses were shared between boat/owner and crew, these costs were multiplied by the % indicated for the vessel owner to assign these costs. Overhead Costs: Survey respondents were given the option of providing these costs either at the vessel level or at the business level. For those respondents who filled in business level costs, the value was divided by the number of vessels owned by the respondent during 2022. The number of vessels owned was taken directly from the survey (Q13). Quota Costs and Revenues: Survey respondents were given the option to provide quota leasing costs either at the vessel-level or across multiple vessels. If this cost was provided across multiple vessels, the value was divided by the specific number of vessels the quota leasing cost was attributed to (Q17). Similar to trip expenses, quota leasing costs were then allocated to the vessel owner based on how the survey respondent indicated these expenses were paid (Q18). If the respondent answered that the crew paid for trip expenses, the assigned cost to the vessel owner was $0. If the respondent answered that the boat/owner paid for trip expenses, 100% of these costs were assigned to the vessel owner. If the respondent answered that trip expenses were shared between boat/owner and crew, these costs were multiplied by the % indicated for the vessel owner to assign these costs. Quota leasing revenue was then subtracted from costs to calculate net quota leasing costs to the vessel. Quota leasing occurs within the groundfish, sea scallop, surf clam/ocean quahog, and tilefish fisheries. Due to net quota leasing representing a small portion of total costs for the various fleets presented on this site, these costs are not included in the cost distribution summaries found in Chapter 7. However quota net leasing costs are included in total profit profiles found in Chapter 9. Other Costs: At the end of the survey, respondents were given the opportunity to list other costs that were not included in the survey. When other costs were listed, they were evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When deemed possible, other costs listed were allocated to an existing cost category. Those that could not be allocated to an existing cost category were excluded from the profit calculation. Examples of costs that were able to be allocated to an existing category include registration fees were added to Permit Fees and non-descript vessel repairs/maintenance were allocated evenly across the various repair/maintenance categories. Two costs, crew supplies and fresh water, that are collected by at-sea observers that were not included in the 2022 cost survey. To capture these costs, data from observer programs was used to calculate average costs per trip by gear. All 2022 trips from observer data tables were pulled, along with the primary gear utilized on each trip. The average crew supply and fresh water trip costs by gear type were calculated and these averages were then merged by gear with all of the trips taken by survey responding vessels during 2022. Finally, trip-level costs were summed to the vessel-level. Operating profit Operating profit refers to gross revenues minus operating costs (variable costs). Within the 2022 cost survey, two sections in particular cover operating costs. The trip expenses section collects information on fuel, bait, ice, and food. The crew payment section includes the total amount paid to crew and hired captains, as well as any benefits paid out. Outside of the survey, a few costs collected by at-sea observers, fresh water and crew supplies, are also included in the operating profit calculation. Equation: Gross Revenue - (Trip Expenses + Crew Payments) Total profit Total profit refers to operating profit minus non-operating costs (fixed and quasi-fixed costs). Within the 2022 cost survey, a few different sections include non-operating costs. The vessel repairs and upgrades section (#2) includes the amount spent on various vessel components including the engine, hull, fishing gear, electronics, and safety equipment. The vessel costs section (#3) factors in mooring fees, permit fees, and vessel insurance. The overhead section (#6) includes, among other costs, business vehicle expenses, association fees, non-crew labor payments, and office/storage expenses. The quota costs and revenue section (#8) is also included as a component of non-operating costs. Lastly, depreciation is estimated from the vessel values section (#7). Equation: Operating Profit - (RMUI/other + Vessel Costs + Overhead + Quota Leasing + Depreciation) 5.4 Additional Methods/Decision Rules 5.4.1 Summary Group Decision Rules 5.4.1.1 Primary Gear Vessel primary gear is defined according to the largest contributor to total commercial vessel revenue during 2022. Fishing gears, primarily from Vessel Trip Reports (VTRs) were grouped into the same categories as used for the 2022 cost survey sampling frame. For example, bottom trawl and midwater trawl were grouped into a broader trawl category. The resulting primary gear groups are as follows: gillnet, handgear, hydraulic dredge, longline, pot/trap, scallop dredge, seine, trawl, and unknown. Due to low response levels for some primary gear groups, results are unable to be presented. The scale of vessel operations, as indicated by revenues and costs, is influenced by vessel characteristics. As such, the Cost Data Visualization Tool is a helpful reference for certain characteristics by gear (e.g. vessel length and average crew) for respondents to the 2022 cost survey. As a sensitivity test, results were examined under the scenario of gear only being defined if 100% of the vessel’s revenue was generated from that gear during 2022. In general, results were similar to those presented on this site. #### Primary Fishery Vessel primary fishery is also defined as the largest contributor to total commercial vessel revenue during 2022. Species were grouped into Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) as managed by the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Councils, as well as American lobster, managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. A few other fisheries (channeled whelk, highly migratory species, striped bass) are also included in summary tables due to sufficient response of at least 3 vessels. Fisheries with at least 5 responding vessels are also included in boxplots. A few other fisheries received low response levels and results are unable to be presented. As a sensitivity test, results were examined under the scenario of fishery only being defined if 100% of the vessel’s revenue was generated from that fishery during 2022. In general, results were similar to those presented on this site. #### Primary Gear/Fishery Vessel primary gear and primary fishery were also combined to examine differences within more specific fleets. For most gear types, multiple fisheries are represented. However, scallop dredge gear, for example, is represented by only one fishery (sea scallop). Due to low response levels for some primary gear/fisheries, results are unable to be presented. 5.4.2 Depreciation The final cost component included in the profit calculation is vessel depreciation. Ideally, a different depreciation value would be assigned to each physical capital component (e.g. electronics, engine, hull) using the estimated market value and age of each piece of vessel equipment. This method would require additional information beyond that collected in the 2022 cost survey. Information on the estimated market vessel value, including all equipment and fishing gear, was collected in the 2022 cost survey. However the number of responses to this question were lower than other survey questions explained in part by the inclusion of a “I prefer not to answer” option, which was not included for other survey questions. Given the relative lack of response for vessel market value, an alternate method was used in which shadow values of vessel characteristics including age, gross tonnage, length, and type of construction were estimated. The shadow values were then multiplied by each vessel characteristic to calculate a total vessel value. From the vessel values, a depreciation cost was calculated as 4% of the value for those vessels less than 25 years old and 2% of the value for those vessels 25 years or older following methods utilized for fishing fleets in Kitts et al. (2020). 5.5 Data Sources and Code 5.5.1 Data Sources Cost Data - (data originally used from flat file but has since been database to Oracle via SSB_COST_SURVEY.VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV Revenue - CAMS 5.5.2 Code Metric Creation Code Files https://github.com/Ardini-NOAA/2022_Vessel_Profit_Snapshots/tree/main/scripts_to_generate_input_files Read Me file (file to run code): N/A Website Production Code Location: https://github.com/Ardini-NOAA/2022_Vessel_Profit_Snapshots Read Me file (file to run code): https://github.com/Ardini-NOAA/2022_Vessel_Profit_Snapshots/blob/main/README.md "],["cost-data-visualization-tool.html", "Chapter 6 Cost Data Visualization Tool 6.1 Product Overview 6.2 List of Metrics 6.3 Metric Descriptions 6.4 Additional Methods/Decision Rules 6.5 Data Sources and Code", " Chapter 6 Cost Data Visualization Tool 6.1 Product Overview This tool summarizes the results of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center cost survey at the commercial fishing vessel-level for costs incurred in 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2022.

For the 2015 survey, a composite value across all cost components was queried. Additionally, for the 2012 survey, a separate line item for “Other Repair/Maintenance Costs” was queried. These costs were binned into “Other Costs” to maintain consistency in this cost category. In 2022, “new” costs incurred were added to this category. The 2011, 2012, and 2022 surveys were queried only at the vessel-level for repair/maintenance costs, while the 2015 survey queried these costs at the vessel-level and business-level. To be consistent with the previous surveys, only vessel-level costs are summarized. Vessel Costs - Combined category of the following sub-costs: Mooring/Dockage Fees State and Federal Permits and/or License Renewal Fees Vessel or Permit Payments Vessel Insurance Premium Description: In 2011, 2012 and 2015, the “Vessel or Permit Payments” variable includes principal paid on business loans and interest paid on business loans while in 2022 it includes amount paid on down payments or loans on vessel/permit purchases (including tax). Overhead costs were calculated at the business-level for 2012 and 2015, but presented here by dividing by the number of vessels owned. Total Payment to Crew/Hired Captain- Combined category of the following sub-costs: Crew Payments Hired Captain Payments Crew Benefits Description: Vessel payments to crew/hired captain and benefits paid to crew/hired captain were queried during each of the four survey years. Total payments to crew and hired captains were collected separately in 2012, 2015, and 2022 and as a single combined value in 2011. The majority of vessel owners across all years (~90%) indicated they did not provide benefits to crew. Crew payments and benefits were aggregated to form the total payment to crew/hired captain category. Total Cost - Combined aggregate of all the above cost categories 6.4 Additional Methods/Decision Rules 6.4.1 Summary Group Decision Rules The primary gear for each vessel is determined by the gear type which yielded the highest revenues from catch sold to a federal dealer in the year in which costs were being investigated. Though each vessel is grouped into a primary gear type, vessel costs are not apportioned to the gear usage, such that the summaries reflect a vessel’s total costs for each year. 6.4.2 Data Quality Control and Outlier Removal There were multiple areas in which data quality was assessed across all survey years. In a small number of cases, a vessel owner filled out multiple surveys within the same year. For these occurrences, only the first returned survey was retained for data analysis. If a survey respondent provided a cost range to a question as opposed to a single value, the average was taken to serve as the reported value. If a survey respondent skipped a particular question, no data imputation was performed and the value was not assumed to be $0.00 unless $0.00 was written by the participant. For detection of data outliers in 2011, 2012 and 2015, any returned survey that contained values greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean for the repair/maintenance, upgrade/improvement, vessel costs, or overhead cost categories was excluded from the data analysis. The total number of survey responses dropped based on the removal of outliers was 12 responses for 2011, 7 responses for 2012, and 5 responses for 2015. The 2022 survey data went through a more rigorous outlier analysis than in previous years which is documented in the data processing Technical Memoranda (forthcoming), which addressed data outliers and data entry errors. 6.5 Data Sources and Code 6.5.1 Data Sources Cost data- SSB_COST_SURVEY.VCS_COMMON_VARIABLES_MV Metadata: https://swerner2.github.io/ORACLE_COST_SURVEY_METADATA/ Number of Crew- Permit Revenue - CFDERS 6.5.2 Code Metric Creation Code File Location: Created on production side Read Me file (file to run code): Created on production side Website Production Code Location: https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-SSB-COST-DATA Read Me file (file to run code): N/A "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
