### Major cost categories 
* Repair/Maintenance & Upgrade/ Improvement - Combined category of the following sub-costs
* Propulsion Engine
* Deck Equipment/Other Machinery
* Hull
* Fishing Gear
* Processing/Refrigeration*
* Safety Equipment
* Haul-out Costs
Description: For the 2011, 2012, and 2022 surveys, the costs for each of these category components was queried separately. For the 2015 survey, a composite value across all cost components was queried. Additionally, for the 2012 survey, a separate line item for "Other Repair/Maintenance Costs" was queried. These costs were binned into "Other Costs" to maintain consistency in this cost category. In 2022, "new" costs incurred were added to this category. The 2011, 2012, and 2022 surveys were queried only at the vessel-level for repair/maintenance costs, while the 2015 survey queried these costs at the vessel-level and business-level. To be consistent with the previous surveys, only vessel-level costs are summarized.
* Vessel Costs - Combined category of the following sub-costs:
* Mooring/Dockage Fees
* State and Federal Permits and/or License Renewal Fees
* Vessel or Permit Payments
* Vessel Insurance Premium
Description: In 2011, 2012 and 2015, the "Vessel or Permit Payments" variable includes principal paid on business loans and interest paid on business loans while in 2022 it includes amount paid on down payments or loans on vessel/permit purchases (including tax). Overhead costs were calculated at the business-level for 2012 and 2015, but presented here by dividing by the number of vessels owned.
* Total Payment to Crew/Hired Captain- Combined category of the following sub-costs:
* Crew Payments
* Hired Captain Payments
* Crew Benefits
Description: Vessel payments to crew/hired captain and benefits paid to crew/hired captain were queried during each of the four survey years. Total payments to crew and hired captains were collected separately in 2012, 2015, and 2022 and as a single combined value in 2011. The majority of vessel owners across all years (~90%) indicated they did not provide benefits to crew. Crew payments and benefits were aggregated to form the total payment to crew/hired captain category.
* Total Cost - Combined aggregate of all the above cost categories 

## Additional Methods/Decision Rules
### Summary Group Decision Rules
The primary gear for each vessel is determined by the gear type which yielded the highest revenues from catch sold to a federal dealer in the year in which costs were being investigated. Though each vessel is grouped into a primary gear type, vessel costs are not apportioned to the gear usage, such that the summaries reflect a vessel's total costs for each year.

### Data Quality Control and Outlier Removal
There were multiple areas in which data quality was assessed across all survey years. In a small number of cases, a vessel owner filled out multiple surveys within the same year. For these occurrences, only the first returned survey was retained for data analysis. If a survey respondent provided a cost range to a question as opposed to a single value, the average was taken to serve as the reported value. If a survey respondent skipped a particular question, no data imputation was performed and the value was not assumed to be $0.00 unless $0.00 was written by the participant. For detection of data outliers in 2011, 2012 and 2015, any returned survey that contained values greater than 5 standard deviations from the mean for the repair/maintenance, upgrade/improvement, vessel costs, or overhead cost categories was excluded from the data analysis. The total number of survey responses dropped based on the removal of outliers was 12 responses for 2011, 7 responses for 2012, and 5 responses for 2015. The 2022 survey data went through a more rigorous outlier analysis than in previous years which is documented in the data processing Technical Memoranda (forthcoming), which addressed data outliers and data entry errors.
