# Overview 

 This site provides an overview of the metrics, and the methods and code used to generate them, produced by the Social Sciences Branch of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center. The intent of this document is to increase access, transferability, and reproducibility of SSB-created works. 
 
# Getting started

### Using the "SSB Metrics Index Table"  
 The "SSB Metrics Index Table" describes a full table of SSB-generated metrics, their level of stratification and time series as well as which product is associated with the metric. Once identifying the metric of interest, you can navigate to the appropriate chapter which describes the methods for creating the metric. 
 
### Product Chapters  
End users can also navigate directly to the product chapter of interest to gain insight on the suite of metrics offered by each individual product. 
 

## Definitions 
*Level of reporting* -  Reporting component  (e.g., vessel, trip) 

*Summary Group(s)* -  Additional stratification of how the unit is grouped, where applicable (e.g., primary FMP) 

*Frequency* - Interval at which data are reported (e.g., Annual, Monthly, quarterly) 

*Time Series* - Data series reported

  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
